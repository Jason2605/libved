```C
/* This code aims to be usefull as an independent text visual editor C library
 * (with an "ala vim" interface), that either can be "#include" it as a single
 * file unit, or by linking, without any other prerequisite other than libc and
 * with a tendency to minimize this dependency by providing an own implementation
 * of some standard C functions, so that can be used in primitive environments.

 * It was written (as a confession!) somehow at a state in time, a little bit
 * after the vt100 introduction and Billy Joy's first "vi", cheating a bit by
 * looking in the future and stole stable code and ideas, and knowing that a
 * character can be represented with more than one byte in a universal character
 * set and with an encodind "yet to be invented" in a restaurant.

 * The current state is at the bootstrap|prototype level. That means that the
 * editor can develop itself, and the basic interface is considered quite close
 * to completion, however:

 * - it doesn't do any validation of the incoming data (the data it produces
 *   is rather controllable, but it cannot handle (for instance) data which
 *   it might be malformed (UTF-8) byte sequences, or escape sequences).

 * - some motions shouldn't behave properly when a character it occupies more than
 *   one cell width, or behave properly if this character is a tab but (for now)
 *   a tab it takes one single cell, much like a space. To implement some of this
 *   functionality an expensive wcwidth() should be included and algorithms should
 *   adjust.

 * - the code is young and fragile in places and some crude algorithms that had
 *   been used during this initiation, need revision and functions needs to catch
 *   more conditions.

 * - it is only tested under a Linux environment, but also the code makes a lot of
 *   assumptions, as it awaits a POSIX environement.

 * It is published mainly for recording reasons and a personal one.
 * The original purpose was to record the development process so it could be
 * usefull as a (document) reference for an editor implementation, but the
 * git commits (during this initiation) ended as huge incrementals commits and
 * there were unusable to describe this "step by step" guide. So it was better to
 * reset git and start fresh.
 * Today, the git commit log messages are serving as a general reference document,
 * where they can describe intentions or semantics (both important, as the first
 * helps the code to develop and the latter sets an expectation). The difference
 * is that every new functionality should be recorded at these messages, though
 * can be more than one (the commits were (and probably will (if there is a will))
 * rather big for the usual conventions.

 * The project was initiated at the end of the autumn of 2018 and at the begining
 * was based at simted (below is the header of this single unit simted.c) and where
 * the author implements a simple ed (many thanks).

   *  Simple Editor written in C using Linked List with undo

 * Code snippets from outer sources should mention this source on top of
 * those blocks; if not, I'm sorry but this is probably an omission and should
 * be fixed.

 * The code constantly runs under valgrind, so it is supposed to have no
 * memory leaks, which it is simple not true, because the conditions in a
 * editor are too many to ever be sure and true. Also diagnostics seems to
 * be dependable from compiler's version which valgrind's version should adjust.

 * Also uncountable segmentation faults were diagnosed and fixed thanks to gdb.

 * The library code can be compiled as a shared or as a static library, with
 * gcc, clang and tcc. */

 /* Testing

 * Included is a very minimal executable that can be used to test the library code.
 * This can be compiled also as static with gcc and clang, but not with tcc.

 * To test the editor issue (using gcc as the default compiler): */
```
```sh
   cd src && make veda-shared

   # or to enable regular expression support issue:

   cd src && make HAS_REGEXP=1 veda-shared

   # by default writing is disabled, unless in DEBUG mode:

   cd src && make HAS_REGEXP=1 DEBUG=1 veda-shared

   # and finally to run the executable and open the source files from itself,
   #  issue (assuming pwd is src directory):

   make run

   # similarly with clang and tcc compilers, but the CC Makefile variable should be
   # set and one way to do this, is from the command line:

   # make CC=tcc ...

   # to run it under valgring

   make check_veda_memory_leaks

   # to open another file use the FILE Makefile variable like:

   make check_veda_memory_leaks FILE=/tmp/file 2>/tmp/valgrind-report

   # to redirect also valgrind's messages

   # you can always use the created binary in sys/bin/
   # but the LD_LIBRARY_PATH should adjust to point to sys/lib

   # of course you can run directly the static executable, that can be compiled
   # with gcc or clang

   # to run the shared executable under gdb:

   make debug_veda

   # to preproccess only

   make preproc

   # to clean up and start over

   make clean

   # similar targets with the shared and for the static library or executable.

/* Interface and Semantics.

 * It is a vi[m] like interface with the adition of a topline that can be disabled,
 * and it is based on modes.

 * Every buffer belongs to a window.
 * A window can have unlimited buffers.
 * A window can also be splited in frames.
 * An Editor instance can have unlimited independed windows.

 * There can be unlimited independed editor instances that can be (de|rea)ttachedÂ¹.

 * Modes.

 * These are mostly like vim and which of course lack much of the rich feature set
 * of vim. That would require quite the double code i believe (actually much more
 * than double).

/* Command line mode:
 * (note) Commands do not get a range as in vi[like], but from the command line
 * switch --range=. Generally speaking the experience in the command line should
 * feel more like a shell and specifically the zsh completion way.

 * Auto completions (triggered with tab):
 *  - commands
 *  - arguments
 *  - filenames

 * If an argument (like a substitution string) needs a space, it should be quoted.

 * If a command takes a filename or a bufname as an argument, tab completion
 * will quote the argument (for embedded spaces).

 * Command completion is triggered when the cursor is at the first word token.

 * Arg completion is triggered when the first char word token is an '-' or
 * when the current command, gets a bufname as an argument.

 * In any other case a filename completion is perfomed.

 * Options are usually long (that means prefixed with two dashes), unless some
 * established/unambiguous like (for now):
 *  -i  for interactive

 * Default command line switches:
 * --range=...
 *    valid ranges:
 *    --range=%    for the whole buffer
 *    --range=linenr,linenr counted from 1
 *    --range=.    for current line
 *    --range=[linenr,.],$  from linenr to the end
 *    --range=linenr,. from linenr to current line
 * without --range, assumed current line number

 * --global          is like the g flag on vim substitute
 * --interactive,-i  is like the c flag on vim substitute
 * --append          is like  >> redirection

 * --pat=`pat'       a string describes the pattern which by default is a literal
                     string; the sample application can use a subset (the most basic)
                     of perl regular expressions: in that case pattern can start with
                     (?i) to denote `ignore case` and for syntax support see at:
                     modules/slre/docs/syntax.md

 * --sub=`replacement string'
                     - '&' can be used to mean the full captured string
                     -  to include a white space, the string should be (double) quoted,
                     -  if has regular expression support, then \1\2... can be used
                        to mean, `nth' captured substring numbering from one.

 * Commands:
 * ! as the last character indicates force, unless is a shell command

 * :s[ubstitute] [--range=] --pat=`pat' --sub=`sub' [-i,--interactive] --global
 * :w[rite][!] [filename  [--range] [--append]]
 * :wq[!]                 (write and quit (if force, do not check for modified buffers))
 * :e[!] [filename]       (when e!, reread from current buffer filename)
 * :enew filename         (new buffer on a new window)
 * :etail                 (like :e! and 'G' (reload and go at the end of file))
 * :split [filename]      (open filename at a new frame)
 * :b[uf]p[rev]           (buffer previous)
 * :b[uf]n[ext]           (buffer next)
 * :b[uf][`|prevfocused]  (buffer previously focused)
 * :b[uf]d[elete][!]      (buffer delete)

 * :r[ead] filename       (read filename into current buffer)
 * :r! cmd                (read into buffer cmd's standard output)
 * :!cmd                  (execute command)
 * :vgrep --pat=`pat' fname[s] (search for `pat' to fname[s])
 * :searches              (change focus to the `search' window)
 * :messages              (change focus to the message buffer)
 * :q[!]                  (quit (if force, do not check for modified buffers))
 */

 /* Searching on files (a really quite basic emulation of quickfix vim's windows).

  * The command :vgrep it takes a pattern and at least a filename as argument[s]:

    :vgrep --pat=`pattern' file[s]

  * This should open a unique window intented only for searches and re-accessible
  * with:

    :searches  (though it might be wise a `:copen' alias (to match vim's expectation))

  * This window should open a frame at the bottom, with the results (if any) and it
  * will set the pointer to the first item from the sorted and unique in items list.

  * A carriage return should open the filename at the specific line number at the
  * frame 0.

  * A `q' on the results frame (the last one), will quit the window and focus again
  * to the previous state (as it acts like a pager).

 /* Menus
  * Many completions (and there are many) are based on menus.
  * Semantics and Keys:
    * Navigation keys:
      - left and right (for left and right motions)
        the left key should move the focus to the previous item on line, unless the
        focus is on the first item in line, which in that case should focus to the
        previous item (the last one on the previous line, unless is on the first line
        which in that case should jump to the last item (the last item to the last
        line))

      - the right key should jump to the next item, unless the focus is on the last
        item, which in that case should focus to the next item (the first one on the
        next line, unless is on the last line, which in that case should jump to the
        first item (the first item to the first line))

      - page down/up keys for page down|up motions

      - tab key is like the right key

    * Decision keys:
      - Enter accepts selection; the function should return the focused item to the
        caller

      - Spacebar can also accept selection if it is enabled by the caller. That is
        because a space can change the initial pattern|seed which calculates the
        displayed results. But using the spacebar speeds a lot of those operations,
        so in most cases is enabled, even in cases like CTRL('n') in insert mode.

      - Escape key aborts the operation

  * In all the cases the window state should be restored afterwards.

 /* Application Interface.
  * The library exposes a root struct, two de|init public functions that
  * de|initialize the structure and quite a lot of opaque pointers.

  * The code uses an object oriented style, though it is just for practical
  * reasons as permits mostly code organization, simplicity, abstraction,
  * compacteness, relationship, and especially quite a lot of freedom to develop
  * or overide functionality.
    A generic comment:
    * But the main advantage of this approach is that there is no global state;
    * the functions acts on an instance of a type, or if not, simple their scope
    * is narrow to a specific job that can not change state to the environment.

    * In this whole library, there is neither one global variable and just one static
    * that utilizes editor commands (even this can be avoided, by adding a property,
    * however this (besides the needless overhead) abstracts abstraction, while the
    * the route in code like this, should be the other way around)).

    * In short, a compact, unified and controlled environment, under a root structure,
    * with functions that act on an own and known type or|and expected and sanitized
    * arguments, within a well defined (with limits) scope.

    * The heavy duty seems to be at the entry points or|and to the communication ports,
    * that check and sanitize external data, or|and interfere with the outer environment.
    * But afterwards, it looks that is just a matter of time, to catch the conditions
    * that can be met and those logically have an end.
       A comment about C.
      * This is a great advantage for the C language, because the code is not going
      * to ever change to adapt a new version; unless is a code mistake, that a new
      * compiler uncovered, but correct code is going to work forever.

    * This could also speed up execution time (by avoiding un-needed checks of a data
    * that is known for certain that is valid, because, either it is produced (usually)
    * by the self/own, or has already been checked, by previous users in the toolchain
    * stack.
    * But the main benefit, is that it brings clarity to the code and concentration
    * to the actual details. However that it could also be considered as a functional
    * envrironment (with the no-side-effect meaning) or as an algorithm environment.

    * It could be a wise future path for C, if it will consentrate just to implement
    * algorithms or standard interfaces.

 * The main structure is the editor structure type, and contains other nested
 * relative structures (that contain others too):

 * (the basic three)
 * - editor type
 * - win type
 * - buf type
 * and
 * - string type
 * - terminal type

 * Many of the algorithms are based on a (usually) double linked list with
 * a head and a tail and in many cases a current pointer, that can act (at
 * the minimum) as an iterator;  but there is no specific list type (just
 * abstracted macros that act on structures. Those structs, and based on
 * the context (specific type), can contain (some or all) of those (everybody
 * C favorites) pointers.

 * A couple of notes regarding the inner code.
 * The inner code it uses a couple of macros to ease the development, like:

    self(method, [arg,...])

 * This awaits an accesible "this" declared variable and it passes the specific
 * type as the first argument to the calling function.
 * In this context "this" is an abstracted variable and works with objects with
 * specific fields. Types like these, have a "prop" field that holds object's
 * variables and as well a "self" dedicated field for methods (function pointers
 * that their function signature contains "this" type as their first argument).

 * The properties of such types are accesible with the following way:

   $my(prop)

 * This reminds a lot of perl (i think) and allows great consistency and little
 * thought (you just have to know the properties and not how to access them
 * through the complicated real code). This should save a hell out of time,
 * during development and it gets very quickly a routine.

 * To access a nested structure there is also a very compact and easy to use way:

   My(Class).method (...)

 * This is just another syntactic sugar, to access quickly and with certainity that
 * you got the pointers right, nested structures. As "My" doesn't pass any argument,
 * any argument[s] should be given explicitly.

 * Generally speaking, those macros, are just syntactic sugar, no code optimization,
 * or the oposite, neither a single bit of penalty. It allows mainly expressionism
 * and focus to the intentions and not to __how__ to get right writting.

 * In that spirit, also available also are macros, that their sole role is to
 * abstract the details over type creation/declaration/allocation, that assists to
 * quick development.
 * The significant ones: AllocType, NewType, DeclareType. Those are getting an
 * argument with the type name but without the _t extension, which is the actual
 * type.

 * Finally, a couple of macros that access the root editor type or the parent's
 * (win structure) type. Either of these three main structures have acces (with one
 * way or the other) to all the fields of the root structure, so My(Class) macro
 * as well the others too, works everywhere the same, if there is a proper
 * declared "this".

 * In the sample executable that uses the library, the "My" macro, has the same
 * semantics, but for the others macros should be no need (though it is too early
 * maybe even talk about an API), as they should be covered with the following way:

    Ed.[subclass or method] ([args, ...])

 * this code has access to the root structure, and should use the get/set
 * specific to types methods to access the underlying properties.

/*
 * Sample Application
 * This application adds regular expression support, by using a slightly modified
 * version of the slre machine, which is an ISO C library that implements a subset
 * of Perl regular expression syntax, see and clone at:

     https://github.com/cesanta/slre.git
 * Many thanks.

 * It is implemented outside of the library by overiding methods from the Re structure.
 * To enable it use "HAS_REGEXP=1" during compilation.
 *
 * The substitution string in the ":substitute command", can use '&' to denote the
 * full captured matched string, but also captures of which denoted with \nth.
 * It is also possible to force caseless searching, by using (like pcre) (?i) in front
 * of the pattern. This option won't work with multibyte characters. Searching for
 * multibyte characters it should work properly though.
 *
 * The application can also run shell commands or to read into current buffer
 * the standard output of a shell command. Interactive applications might have
 * unexpected behavior in this implementation. To disable these features (as they
 * are enabled by default) use "HAS_SHELL_COMMANDS=0" during compilation.
 */

/*
 * Memory Interface
 * The library uses the reallocarray() from OpenBSD (a calloc wrapper that catches
 * integer overflows), and it exposes a public mutable handler function that is
 * invoked on such overflows or when there is not enough memory available errors.

 * This function is meant to be set by the user of the library, on the application
 * side and scope. The provided one exits the program with a detailed message.
 * I do not know the results however, if this function could wait for an answer
 * before exits, as (theoretically) the user could free resources, and return for
 * a retry. The function signature should change to account for that.

 * The code defines two those memory wrappers.
 * Alloc (size) and Realloc (object, size). Both like their counterparts, they return
 * void *.

/* TO DO
 * Seriously! Please do not use this on sensitive documents. There are many conditions
 * that i know and for certain quite many that i don't know, that it might need to be
 * handled.
 * The bad thing here is that there is a workflow and in that workflow range i fix
 * things or develop things. But for sure there are conditions or combinations of them
 * out of this workflow.

 * But Really. The real interest is to use this code as a reference and probable as
 * an underline machine to create another machine.

 * But it would also be nice (besides to fix bugs) if i could reserve sometime to fix
 * the tabwidth stuff, which is something i do not have the slightest will to do,
 * because i hate tabs in code (nothing is perfect in this life).
 * I'd rather give my time (with low priority though) to split those two different
 * consepts.

  The first level or better the zero level, the actual editor code:

   - inserting/deleting lines (this should meet or extend ed specifications)

   - line operations where line as:
     An array of characters that provide information or methods about the
     actual num bytes used to consist each character and the utf8 representation.

     Line operations: inserting/deleting/replacing..., based on that type.

   - /undo/redo

   - basically the ed interface, which at the begining coexisted happily with
     the visual one (at some point too much code were written at once and which
     it should adjust to work in both interfaces, but the abstraction level wasn't
     enough abstracted for this, so i had to move on); but it is a much much simpler
     editor to implement, since there is absolutelly no need to handle the output
     or|and to set the pointer to the right line pointed to the right cell at the
     correct byte[s] (it is very natural such an interface to over complicate the
     code and such code to have bugs).
     From my humbled experience, the worst bug that can happen is to have a false
     interpretation of the position, so you actually edit something else than what
     you thing you edit.

  And the second level the obvious one (the above mentioned bugged one).

/* My opinion on this editor.

 * It is assumed of course, that this product is not meant for wide production use;
 * but even if it was, it is far far faaaar away to the completion, but is an editor
 * which implements at least the basic operation set that can be considered enough
 * to be productive, which runs really low in memory resources and with rather few
 * lines of code. Theoretically (assuming the code is good enough) it could be used
 * in situations (such primitive environments), since is indepentent and that is a
 * very interesting point.

 * And this (probably) is the reason for the persistence to self sufficiency.
 * The other (probably again and by digging around the mind) is about some beliefs
 * about the language and its ecosystem.

 * But first, there isn't such a thing as self sufficiency!

 * Today our dependency, our libc environment, is more like a collection of individual
 * functions, which their (usually tiny) body is mainly just algorithms (and so and
 * machine code as this is a property of C), with few (or usually without) conditional
 * branches.

 * However those functions and for a reason, are unware for anything out of their
 * own domain. They have no relationship between their (lets group), as they do not
 * even have a sense that belong to a group, such: "I am a string type function!
 * (and what is a string anyway?)".

 * But first, libc'es are not thin at all. It would be great if you could just cherry pick
 * (specific functionality) from this pool but without to carry all the weight of the
 * pool. So it could be easy to build an own independent pool of functions with a way
 * (something like the Linux kernel or gnu-lib projects do).

 * It could be great if the programmer could extract the specific code and hook it to
 * his program, so it could optimize it for the specific environment. As an example:
 * At the begining this program implemented the strdup() function with the standard
 * signature, having as "const char *src" as the only argument. Since this function
 * it returns an allocated string, it should iterate over the "src" string to find its
 * length. At some point i realized that in the 9/10 of the cases, the size was already
 * known, so the extra call to strlen() it was overhead for no reason. So i changed the
 * signature and added a "size_t len" argument. In this application the str_dup() is
 * one of the most called functions. So this extra argument was a huge and for free
 * and with total safety optimization. And from understanding, C is about:
   - freedom
   - flexibility and
   - ... optimization

 * But how about a little more complex task, like an input functionality.
 * It goes like this:
    save terminal state - raw mode - get key - return the key - reset term

 * All well except the get key () function. What it will return? An ascii code in
 * UTF-8 era is usually useless. You want a signed int (if i'm not wrong).
 * So there is no other way, when the first byte indicates a byte sequence, than
 * to deal with it, into the getkey() scope. So you probably need an UTF-8 library.
 * But in reality is 10/20 lines of code, for example see:
    term_get_input (term_t *this)
 * (which is going to be published as a separate project, if time permits).

 * It will also has to deal with the terminal escape sequenses and returns reliably
 * the code for all the keyboard keys for all the known terminals.
 * This is easy because is one time job and boring testing, or simply usage from
 * different users on different terminals.
 * The above mentioned function, it looks that it deals well with xterm/linux/urxvt
 * and st from suckless terminals, in 110 lines of code reserved for this.

 * This specific example is an example of a function that is written once and works
 * forever, without a single change. But it is a function with a broader meaning (the
 * functionality), but nevertheless a function. And surely can belong to a standard
 * libc, with the logic sense as it makes sense, even if it is rather an interface
 * (because it is not a standalone function).
 * So point two: libc'es can broad a bit their scope, if C wants to have an evolution
 * and a endless feature as it deserves.
 * It's like forkpty() which wraps perfect the details of three different functions.
 * I guess what i'm really talking about is a bit more synthetic than forkpty().

 * And it would be even greater if you could easily request a collection, that use
 * each other properties, to build a task, like an editor. As standard algrorithm!
 * I could [fore]see used a lot. This particular is a prototype and not yet ready,
 * but this is the idea and is a general one and it seems that it could be usefull
 * for all; they just have to connect to C and use these algorithms.
