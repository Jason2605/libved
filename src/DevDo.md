/*  Development Tracker  */

Implement:

:w[q]bd
  also:
    command chain:
      :-w bd w q
      :-w bd(self, int: 1) w q
        - that means an intented interpreter buffer
          - and since we went too far:
            a parser and executer
              this smells like an object system
              that it simply add functionality by request
              which then this: (the way it was requested)
                becomes syntax of the system as-is (or
                slightly developed) - if supposedly could
                be kept an image of the last succesfull
                request, this should produce the requested
                result with success

Extend:
  - libxdiff.c [executable] providing unified diff

Search:
  - re-search (new pattern) (after an accepted (with a way) result)
